As a data scientist with Fellowship.ai Iâ€™ve worked on a range of projects, from CTOR prediction for email banners to customer segmentation analysis and churn prediction. I have experience deploying workable models into Streamlit apps, R Shiny dashboards and in Docker containers for exploration and practical use. Beyond my programming work, what sets me apart is my love for telling compelling data stories that drive organizational change.
