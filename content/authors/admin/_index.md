# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: As a data scientist I’ve created prediction algorithms for the hotels in Portugal, identified the greatest contributing factors to rider churn rates for a cab company and developed a recommendation engine for an e-commerce site in Brazil. I’ve deployed my work in Streamlit apps, R Shiny dashboards and in Docker containers. Beyond my work, what sets me apart is my ability to translate results into compelling data stories that drive organizational change.
